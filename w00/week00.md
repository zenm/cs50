# What did you learn?

I turned in my scratch game called [Sully](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/151735136/).


During this week in CS50 week 0...


computer science is about
* problem solving, taking inputs and creating outputs


define the 'black box'
* something that solves your problem, even if you might not know or care how it solves your problem


name the first input into a computer
* electricity. Turning electricity from on and off into binary.


define unary
* where you have one symbol, you add another one to it, now you have two. Adding one to another.


define binary
* where you have two symbols to represent counting. 0 and 1.


describe how to count in binary
* in powers of 2, you count from the ones place, then you multiply either 0 or 1 to that. Add the products of the binary to the place to get the number you want.


0 0 0 0, is 0 because
* 16 * 0 + 4 * 0 + 2 * 0 + 1 * 0 = 0


0 1 0 1, is 5 because
* 16 * 0 + 4 * 1 + 2 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 5


define bit
* binary digit, the place in the powers of 2 when counting in binary


define byte
* eight bits


name how to represent letters to a computer
* the world decided on a standard mapping of letters and numbers called ASCII.


Name how a computer would understand the letters  A, B, C
* According to ASCII, computers know these as numbers 65,66, and 67.


Name how a computer could represent color
* Computer represent colors by mixing RGB, red blue green, in certain ratios of numbers.
Lean in real close to the computer screen, and you can see dots on it. Those dots, also known as ___ along with RGB applied to them, make

pictures or text
* pixels


Images one after the other can form a  
* video


Define algorithm
* a set of instructions used to solve a problem


Describe how you might find a name in a phonebook
1. take name
2. open book
3. search for name in book
4. does name appear in first half of book or second half of book
5. if first, open towards middle of first half of book
6. if last, open towards middle of last half of book
7. repeat until you find name"


A name for actions in an algorithm  
* functions


A name for decisions made in an algorithm
* branches. signified by if, else if. Made if the branch satisfies an expression of true.


Define Boolean expression
* An expression, that can either be true or false.


Define what it means to repeat steps in an algorithm
* We call repeating steps a 'loop'


linear vs algorithmic slope
* you can graph the efficiency of an algorithm by the number of steps it takes to get to a solution. When you solve algorithmically, steps to a solution scale trivially.
